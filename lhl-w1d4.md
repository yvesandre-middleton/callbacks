## LHL - W1D4 - CALLBACK FUNCTIONS

# You can put anything as a variable or argument or paramater so you can pass a function to a function  - function arguments - call back function

  * Functions that return or takes a function are called higher order functions.
  * Functions that functions as an argument will not work when not given a function
  * as a parameter.
